"""Base abstractions for ephemeral reminders injected at API-call time.

Reminders are short-lived guidance notes (system hints, out-of-band user
steers, etc.) that are injected into the *current turn's user/tool message copy*
before it is sent to the model. They are never persisted to the message
history, so the upstream prompt-cache prefix stays stable.
