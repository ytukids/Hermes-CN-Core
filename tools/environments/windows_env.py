# ctypes Win32 call, and merged/deduped the result — pure I/O the terminal tool
# paid on the hot path (root-cause-analysis.md, hotspot #6; ~5-15ms per call on
# cold machines).
#
# The Windows *Environment* registry keys change rarely — only when the user (or
# an installer the agent ran) edits PATH.  So instead of a blind time-TTL (which
# would risk missing a just-installed tool, defeating P-020's whole point), we
# key the cache on the two Environment keys' last-write timestamps
# (``QueryInfoKey``).  When the signature is unchanged since the last successful
# apply, ``os.environ`` already reflects the registry and the expensive value
# read + expand + merge is skipped; when a tool install bumps a key's mtime the
# next call refreshes immediately.  Reading the signature (~0.03ms) is ~4x
# cheaper than a full refresh (~0.15ms) and detects installs with zero staleness
