"""[CN-fork] P-033 — in-process disk I/O for the local Windows backend.

On Windows the fork forces Windows PowerShell 5.1 as the only shell, which has
none of the POSIX tools (``wc``/``sed``/``head``/``mktemp``/``cat``) that
``ShellFileOperations`` shelled out to.  That made ``read_file`` unusable
(issue #53) and made ``write_file`` silently report success while writing
nothing (issue #54).  These tests force the in-process path (``_IS_WINDOWS``
monkeypatched True + a real ``LocalEnvironment``) so the Linux/macOS CI runner
exercises exactly the code that runs on a Windows desktop, and assert the two
behaviours that were broken: reads work, and writes actually land on disk with
a truthful byte count.
