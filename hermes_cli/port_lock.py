"""Cross-process port coordination via advisory lock files.

When multiple Hermes instances (CLI dashboards, desktop-managed dashboards,
gateways, proxies) share a host, they use a lightweight lock file under
``$HERMES_HOME/.port-locks/<port>.lock`` to reserve ports before binding.
The lock is advisory and auto-released when the holding process exits.

The lock directory is created on first use. If locking cannot be performed
(for example on a read-only filesystem), the helpers fall back to a no-op
``PortLock`` so startup is not blocked.
